# TECH Clean California UI/UX Integration Summary

## Overview

#### Enrolled Contractors  
1. **Enhanced Dashboard**: TECH widget shows active projects, metrics, and quick actions
2. **Project Management**: Full TECH project lifecycle management
3. **Documentation**: Photo upload and compliance tracking system
4. **Incentive Tracking**: Payment status and processing timeline
5. **Seamless Integration**: Switch between NAMC and TECH contexts naturally
