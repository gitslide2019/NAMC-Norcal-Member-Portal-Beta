## ‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS & AREAS FOR ENHANCEMENT

### Backend Integration
- **Limited Backend:** While NAMCNorCalMemberPortalV2 has a full backend, the main SPA uses CSV files
- **Real-time Data:** No live database integration in the primary application
- **API Integration:** Mock data instead of live API calls

### Security Enhancements Needed
- **Password Security:** Demo mode accepts any password for CSV members
- **Production Credentials:** Hardcoded admin credentials need environment variables
- **Token Security:** Client-side JWT storage could be enhanced

### Missing Integrations
- **Shopify Integration:** Finance hub references shop but no live integration
- **Email Notifications:** Limited notification system
- **Payment Processing:** No integrated payment system
- **Document Management:** No file upload/storage system in SPA

### Scalability Considerations
- **Data Persistence:** CSV-based data not suitable for production scale
- **State Management:** Could benefit from more robust state management for larger datasets
- **Performance:** Large datasets might require pagination and virtualization

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCEMENT

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend Integration:** Connect SPA to NAMCNorCalMemberPortalV2 backend
2. **Security Hardening:** Implement proper password management and secure credential storage
3. **Data Persistence:** Migrate from CSV to database-backed data management
4. **API Development:** Create RESTful APIs for all major functions

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. **Real-time Features:** WebSocket integration for live messaging and notifications
2. **Mobile App:** React Native version for mobile access
3. **Advanced Analytics:** Business intelligence dashboard with trends and predictions
4. **Integration Platform:** Connect with external services (Shopify, payment processors, CRM)

### Long-term Strategic Goals
1. **Multi-chapter Support:** Extend platform to other NAMC chapters nationwide
2. **Advanced AI Features:** Enhanced contract analysis, project matching, risk assessment
3. **Marketplace Integration:** Direct integration with project bidding platforms
4. **Compliance Tools:** Automated certification tracking and renewal management
