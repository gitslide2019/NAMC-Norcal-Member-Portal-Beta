name: "NAMC NorCal Integrated Business Platform - Green Contractor Ecosystem PRP"
description: |

## Purpose
Comprehensive PRP for enhancing the existing NAMC NorCal Member Portal (NAMCNorCalMemberPortal2025) with green building capabilities to create an integrated business platform. This builds upon the proven foundation of 68+ active members and $312K annual revenue, adding green building opportunity matching, environmental impact tracking, and energy efficiency program integration.

## Core Principles
1. **Green Building Domain First**: Understand electrification, retrofit, and green construction business rules
2. **Impact Measurement**: Track jobs created, carbon reduced, and communities served
3. **Government Compliance**: Meet DEI requirements for utility and government contracts
4. **Opportunity Matching**: AI-powered contractor-to-project matching system
5. **Financial Integration**: Built-in funding assistance and capital access
6. **Accessibility Required**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for government accessibility standards
7. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for field workers
8. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: Adhere to all NAMC-specific project rules and conventions

---

## Goal
Enhance the existing NAMC NorCal Member Portal (NAMCNorCalMemberPortal2025) with green building capabilities to create a comprehensive growth engine for minority contractors. Building upon the proven platform with 68+ active members generating $312K annually, we will add green building opportunity matching, environmental impact tracking, energy efficiency program integration, and sponsor analytics to connect contractors to $10B+ in green building opportunities.

## Why
- **Market Opportunity**: California's electrification mandates creating $10B+ opportunity with Federal IRA funding flowing to local programs
- **Sponsor Value**: Utilities like PG&E need certified minority contractors to meet diversity requirements for climate funding
- **Contractor Need**: Members struggle to access green building opportunities due to manual processes and lack of specialized knowledge
- **Impact Tracking**: Current systems don't measure job creation, carbon reduction, or community impact for sponsor reporting
- **Competitive Advantage**: No platform exists that combines minority contractor certification with green building opportunity matching
- **Revenue Growth**: Platform enables diversified revenue streams from memberships, transaction fees, and sponsor packages

## What
Enhanced modules for the existing NAMCNorCalMemberPortal2025 platform, adding green building capabilities to the proven foundation:

- **Compliance Training**: OSHA, lead RRP, and environmental justice education
- **Continuing Education**: Green building code updates and emerging technology training

### 5. Enhanced Finance Hub 
**Extend Existing Finance Hub ($312K Revenue Platform):**
- **Green Financing Tools**: Working capital loans for green projects, equipment financing for heat pumps/solar
- **Tax Credit Optimization**: IRA tax credit calculator and monetization services
- **Project ROI Analysis**: Cash flow modeling for green building projects
- **Green Bond Funding**: Connect contractors to green social bond opportunities

### 6. Sponsor & Utility Integration
**New Module for Energy Program Sponsors:**
- **Real-Time Impact Dashboard**: Track contractors activated, projects completed, investment deployed
- **Program Creation Wizard**: Sponsors create targeted energy efficiency programs
- **Automated Compliance Reporting**: CPUC diversity reports, federal grant requirements
- **Contractor Performance Analytics**: Success rates, environmental impact, and diversity metrics

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 750 new certified green contractors recruited annually

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Foundation & Green Building Data Model (Weeks 1-2)
```typescript
// 1. Database Schema Implementation
// Add green building entities to existing Prisma schema
// Focus on opportunities, programs, certifications, and impact tracking

// 2. Core API Routes for Green Building Data
// app/api/opportunities/route.ts - CRUD operations for green opportunities
// app/api/programs/route.ts - Energy program management
// app/api/certifications/route.ts - Contractor certification tracking
// app/api/impact/route.ts - Environmental and economic impact measurement

// 3. Basic Green Building Components
// components/opportunities/OpportunityCard.tsx - Display green projects
// components/programs/ProgramCard.tsx - Show energy efficiency programs
// components/shared/ImpactMetrics.tsx - Environmental impact visualization
```

### Phase 2: Opportunity Matching System (Weeks 3-4)
```typescript
// 1. Smart Matching Algorithm
// utils/matching-engine.ts - AI-powered contractor-opportunity matching
// Consider: certifications, location, capacity, equipment, past performance

// 2. Address-Based Opportunity Finder

### Government Compliance
- ‚ùå Don't ignore prevailing wage requirements
- ‚ùå Don't skip DEI reporting for sponsors
- ‚ùå Don't forget audit trails for compliance
- ‚ùå Don't ignore accessibility requirements

### Financial Integration
